# Keyword variables in Javascript ES6 (EcmaScript 6)

1. var: this keyword is function-scoped, but not block-scoped, and, therefore, it is not a best practice to use it.

2. let: this keyword was introduced in ES6 and is used to declare block-scoped variables that can be reassigned. 

3. const: this keyword was introduced in ES6 and is used to declare block-scoped variables that cannot be reassigned, i.e., whose value remains constant. 

Note: block scoped means the variable is only accessible within the block (function, loop, or conditional) in which it is declared. 
Variables can only be declared once. Trying to declare a variable twice renders an error.

// Declaring a variable with let:
let _name = "Alice";
console.log(_name); // Output: Alice
_name = "Bob";
console.log(_name); // Output: Bob

// Declaring a variable with const:
const number = 30;
console.log(number + 1); // Output: 31
//number = 0 // Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

// Primitives are copied by value:

let a = 1;
let b = a;

a = 2;
console.log(b); // Output: 1

/*
When you assign an immutable data type (number, string, or boolean) to a new variable, a copy (rather than a reference) of the same value is created.
This means that changes made to the original variable will not affect the new variable.
*/

// ##############################################################

// Objects are copied by reference:

a = { value: 1 };
b = a;

a.value = 2;
console.log(b.value); // Output: 2

/*
When you assign a mutable data type (arrays, or objects/hash tables) to a new variable, another reference (pointer) to the same underlying data structure in memory is created. 
Both variables will point to the same memory location where the data structure is stored. 
This means that any changes made to the data through the original variable will be reflected in the new variable as well.
