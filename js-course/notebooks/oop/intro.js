Programming paradigms (styles of programming).

1. Declarative programming: is a style of programming that focuses on describing what the program should return rather than explicitly detailing all the steps on how to achieve the result (high level of abstraction).

2. Functional programming: is a subset of declarative programming in which programs are built with functions as first-class citizens. This means that functions can be passed as arguments, and the body of the function has expressions about what the output should be.

3. Imperative programming: is a style of programming that follows a step-by-step instruction with an algorithm-like implementation (low level of abstraction).

4. Procedural programming: is a subset of imperative programming that emphasizes writing procedures or functions operating on data. As systems grow, managing state and interactions across many functions can become difficult. If not carefully structured, this can lead to tangled and unmaintainable logic, often referred to as "spaghetti code".

5. Object-oriented programming (OOP): is a programming paradigm supported by many programming languages such as C#, Java, Ruby, C++, Python, and JavaScript. It is useful to reduce spaghetti code by grouping related data and behaviors within classes, providing encapsulation and abstraction.

Note: "spaghetti code" is not unique to procedural programming, it can occur in any paradigm when control flow and dependencies become overly complex. Historically, the term referred to unstructured code with excessive GOTO statements.

The 4 pillars (core concepts) of OOP are:

1 - Encapsulation: is a concept used to organize the code into reusable objects (units) that contain both data (attributes or properties) and behaviors (functions a.k.a methods). Objects are implemented with classes, and behaviors are methods within the class. 

2 - Abstraction: is a concept used to hide complex implementation details (which are not required to be exported) of the code from the user. This is typically achieved by defining private properties and methods using the # syntactic marker and the let keyword.

3 - Inheritance: is a concept where a new class (called a subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). Thus avoiding code redundancy.

4 - Polymorphism: "is a concept that allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common superclass" â€”Lenovo. The primary goal of polymorphism is to enable more refactored and reusable code.

Note: refactoring means changing the code without changing its functionality.
